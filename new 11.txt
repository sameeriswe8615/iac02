#Create New Server Block Files

To begin, we will need to set up the directory that our server blocks will be stored in, as well as the directory that tells Nginx that a server block is ready to serve to visitors. The sites-available directory will keep all of our server block files, while the sites-enabled directory will hold symbolic links to server blocks that we want to publish. 

mkdir /etc/nginx/sites-available
mkdir /etc/nginx/sites-enabled

# Default server block file location is 

/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# Nginx conf file 

 /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
 
# enable server block file to link up from default locatoin to new location.

sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/example.com.conf
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/example2.com.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/example2.com.conf
